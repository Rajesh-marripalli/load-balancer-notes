My Recommendation for Your Specific Needs

Based on your requirements (flexibility, scalability, health monitoring, high availability, security, UI/management, cost efficiency, and Tomcat suitability), here's my definitive recommendation:
ðŸŽ¯ TOP CHOICE: NGINX

Why NGINX is your best bet:
âœ… Perfectly Matches Your Requirements:

    Flexibility: Can act as web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer
    Scalability: Handles 80k+ RPS with minimal resource usage
    Health Monitoring: Built-in upstream health checks
    High Availability: Master-worker architecture, graceful reloads
    Security: Excellent SSL/TLS, rate limiting, access controls
    Management: Simple config files + optional NGINX Plus web UI
    Cost Efficiency: Open source version is completely free
    Tomcat Support: Excellent HTTP proxy to Tomcat instances

Real-World Benefits:

    Learning Curve: Easier than HAProxy, more powerful than Apache
    Resource Usage: Uses 90% less memory than Apache HTTP Server
    Dual Purpose: Serves static content AND load balances
    Community: Massive community support and documentation
    Future-Proof: Modern architecture, actively developed

ðŸ¥ˆ SECOND CHOICE: HAProxy

If you need maximum performance and have experienced admins
ðŸ¥‰ THIRD CHOICE: Traefik

If you're using containers/Kubernetes
Quick Decision Tree:

Choose NGINX if:

    You want the best balance of features, performance, and ease of use
    You need both web server and load balancer functionality
    You want excellent Tomcat integration with minimal complexity
    This applies to 80% of use cases

Choose HAProxy if:

    You need absolute maximum performance (100k+ RPS)
    You have complex routing requirements
    You have experienced system administrators

Choose Apache HTTP Server if:

    You're already heavily invested in Apache ecosystem
    You need AJP protocol support
    You want familiar tools and extensive module ecosystem

For your Tomcat applications, NGINX is the sweet spot - it gives you enterprise-grade performance with much simpler configuration than HAProxy, better performance than Apache, and lower resource usage than both.
