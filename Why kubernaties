Why Use Kubernetes if We Already Have Load Balancers?
1. Load balancers only handle traffic distribution
A load balancer can:

Distribute incoming requests between servers.

Do basic health checks.

Terminate SSL.

But it doesn’t manage applications or containers.

If a server crashes or a container fails inside it, the load balancer doesn’t automatically redeploy or scale that app — it just stops sending traffic to the dead node.

2. Kubernetes manages the entire application lifecycle
Kubernetes does much more than routing:

Scheduling containers onto available nodes.

Auto-scaling applications based on load.

Self-healing — restarts failed Pods automatically.

Rolling updates & rollbacks without downtime.

Service discovery inside the cluster.

3. Kubernetes integrates load balancing into a bigger system
Inside Kubernetes:

ClusterIP — Internal-only load balancing between Pods.

NodePort — Exposes services on a port on every node.

LoadBalancer — Connects to cloud load balancers.

Ingress Controller — Adds advanced routing for multiple apps using one public IP.

The cloud load balancer is just one part of this routing chain — Kubernetes makes sure apps inside the cluster are reachable, healthy, and scalable.

4. Without Kubernetes
If you only used cloud load balancers:

You’d have to manually create and destroy VM instances for scaling.

Deployments and updates would be manual and error-prone.

Internal communication between microservices would be harder to manage.

Failures would require manual intervention.

5. With Kubernetes + Load Balancer
Cloud load balancer:

Public entry point, SSL, DDoS protection.

Kubernetes:

Manages the actual apps behind the load balancer.

Keeps them running, scales them, and updates them.

Provides internal service discovery & traffic routing.
